        <p>We have worked with students from many different countries in person, as well as by Skype, QQ, phone and email.</p>
        <p>
            For students applying from abroad the U.S. college application process is complicated. You need a reliable state-side resource to help in choosing appropriate programs and schools, assist with coordinating applications and credentials, and act as a liaison
            to follow-up with your applications. International students, depending on the country they come from, the language they speak, and the type of secondary school (high school) they attend, will have additional application requirements, such
            as educational credentials evaluated by a professional service, proof of English-language ability (through the TOEFL or other tests), as well as proof of financial ability to pay tuition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our counselors have also worked with many transfer students over the years. Because they have already experienced college life, we can help them use their knowledge of what they did and did not like about their current situation to find the right fit.
            For those coming from a community college, we can orient them to the application process from the transfer perspective, and assess their best fit socially as well as academically. We offer guidance with the preparation of a balanced and strategic
            college list, support with writing the transfer application essays and statements, as well as assistance with any other aspect that comes up in the application process. As with our high school clients, we break the process down into manageable
            steps and keep them on track as they juggle their many responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Last but not least, we have flexible programs and payment options, students can choose the service that they need most with a reasonable cost.
